            <h1 class="big-txt">Preparation</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions, garlic, and ginger and cook until softened.</li>
                <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring regularly, until lightly browned and juices run clear.</li>
                <li>Add celery and cook, stirring regularly, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until softened.</li>
                <li>Add fish sauce and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, skimming any scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and continue to cook until chicken is cooked through.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, combine about 1/2 cup of the hot broth and atsuete powder. Stir until atsuete is dissolved. Add atsuete water to pot.</li>
                <li>Add carrots and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until half-done. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Add sotanghon noodles and push down into broth to soften, stirring gently to separate.</li>
                <li>Ladle soup into bowls and top with boiled eggs, fried garlic bits and green onions. Serve hot.</li>
                <li>When noodles have slightly softened, add cabbage and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes or until noodles are cooked and vegetables are tender yet crisp.</li>
