            We make this beloved dessert with not-too-sweet buttermilk cake and
            very lightly sweetened whipped cream. The cake tastes best just
            slightly chilled, so let it sit out to warm up a bit while you whip
            the cream for the topping.

            Use any combination of ripe summer fruit you can find for this fresh
            fruit "pizza." The crust is one big sugar cookie that can be baked a
            day ahead and kept well wrapped until you're ready to spread it with
            the cream-cheese topping (which you can also make a day ahead). The
            dough could double as your go-to sugar cookie recipe too--just form
            it into balls and bake at 350 degrees F for a soft, chewy treat.

            These simple drop cookies give your oven a break: they start on the
            stovetop – where all the ingredients are mixed – and then finish and
            set in the fridge. They are also perfect for making with kids: all
            of the ingredients are pantry staples, clean-up is easy and there
            are no raw eggs. If your household has allergy concerns, then swap
            the peanut butter out with your favorite smooth nut or seed butter
            like almond, cashew or sunflower butter. Refrigerate the cookies in
            an airtight container and have chilled treats for after school or as
            special snacks. This recipe also makes a generous amount of cookies
            (5 dozen!) so keep it in mind the next time you need a giftable
            sweet.
