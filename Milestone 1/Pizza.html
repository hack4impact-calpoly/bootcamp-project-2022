        <h3 class="Ingredients">Step-by-step Instructions</h3>
        <h4 class="Subprocess" > Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, salt, and yeast in a bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer. Stir to combine. Add the water and 1 tbsp olive oil and stir until a raggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.</li>
            <li>Attach the dough hook to a stand mixer and start the mixer on medium-low speed, then allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the kneading is finished, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Using floured hands, gently shape each half into a boule (ball shape) by folding the dough under itself. Set each boule on a floured surface and dab the dough with a bit of olive oil to keep it moist. Cover all boules with a damp towel and allow them to rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to separate sealed containers, large enough for the dough to double in size again, and store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li>The day of serving, remove the dough from the containers, place it on a lightly floured surface covered with a towel, and allow it to come to room temperature before stretching, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stretch the dough, making sure that it is not overworked. Use flour if dough is too sticky to work with. Shape it into whatever size and shape you desire.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="Subprocess">Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the garlic into a few rough pieces (no need to mince it).</li>
            <li>Place the garlic, tomatoes, oregano, salt, and olive oil in a blender. Blend until fully combine.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="Subprocess">Assembly</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven to its highest possible temperature</li>
            <li>Slice mozzarella into desired slices </li>
            <li>Cover dough with sauce, and add the cheese</li>
            <li>Bake pizza for around 7 minutes (until the cheese melts). Add Basil, cut into slices, serve, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
