                    <li>1/4 cup of sugar</li>
                    <li>250 grams of full-fat mascarpone cheese (cold)</li>
                    <li>24 ladyfingers biscuits (Savoiardi Biscuits)</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the coffee first so it has time to cool. Set it aside in a medium-sized bowl.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer, or using a hand-held mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed until thick and creamy, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the mascarpone in two or three increments, and beat until just combined and smooth (don't overbeat- it is fine if some lumps will remain). Transfer mixture to a bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>In a clean bowl, use clean whisks to beat the egg whites starting on low and increasing speed once foamy. Beat until stiff peaks form, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 of the egg whites to the mascarpone mixture and gently fold through to incorporate. Repeat with remaining egg whites.</li>
            <li>Quickly dip one ladyfinger at a time in the coffee and place on the bottom of a 9×13-inch dish (11×9 will also work).</li>
            <li>Cover the layer of ladyfingers with half of the mascarpone cream, spreading evenly. Top with another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers, then spread with remaining mascarpone cream. Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Cover tightly, refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight. When ready to serve, dust with cocoa powder and serve chilled.</li>
        </ol>
