                <li> 1/2 cup granulated sugar </li>
                <li> 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
                <li> 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted </li>
                <li> 1 egg </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
                <li> 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda </li>

        <ol class = "recipe_page_text">
            <li> In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps. </li>
            <li> Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. </li>
            <li> Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies). </li>
            <li> Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be. </li>
            <li> Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
            <li> Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. </li>
            <li> Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. </li>
            <li> Cool completely before serving. </li>
        </ol>
