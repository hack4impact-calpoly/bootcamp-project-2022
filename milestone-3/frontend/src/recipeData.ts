    instructions:[ 'Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.', 'Heat olive oil in a large skillet (with a cover) over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs and sear for 2 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove chicken from the pan.',  'To the now-empty pan, add rice, chicken broth, lemon juice, and Italian seasoning. If the chicken broth you are using is unsalted, add ½ teaspoons salt. Stir to mix. Return the chicken to the pan, placing it on top of the rice mixture.',  'Cover the skillet and bring it to a brief boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low or the temperature-setting that maintains a steady, gentle simmer.

Cook for 15 minutes or until all of the liquid has been absorbed into the rice, and the chicken is completely cooked. The USDA considers chicken to be fully cooked when a food thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F. Remove from heat and adjust flavor with additional salt and pepper as needed.',  'Serve the chicken and rice warm topped with optional parsley.']},
