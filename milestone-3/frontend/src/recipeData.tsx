    {name: "Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen", 
    description: "Tonkotsu ramen is a Japanese noodle soup made with a pork bone brothâ€”ton means pork and kotsu means bone.

    ingredients: ["pork neck bones", "chicken carcass, onions"], 
    instructions: ["Place the pork bones into a large stock pot, and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil and cook for 10 minutes.",
                    "Skim all of the gunk off of the top of the water. Dump the whole pot out, saving the bones, and fill with fresh water. This is cleaning the bones and will make a better stock.", 
                    "Let cool for a while, and then remove all of the solids you can with tongs and a slotted spoon. Next, strain the broth with cheesecloth or a large clean kitchen towel. I have found the easiest way to do this is to place the cheesecloth in several layers over a large bowl that will fit all of the broth, pour the broth in, and then gather the edges of the cloth together to pull all of the solids out of the broth. You can do this however is easiest for you though!"],
