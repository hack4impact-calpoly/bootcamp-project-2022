                    <li>
                        Heat oven to 350F and line a 9x13 baking dish with
                        parchment paper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whisk together 2 1/2 cups of flour (300g) with the
                        powdered sugar and salt, then pour in the melted butter
                        and mix until combined. You can also do this using a
                        stand mixer with a paddle attachment. If you'd like a
                        dash of vanilla can be added in with the butter at this
                        step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sprinkle the dough into your lined pan and press down
                        into a flat layer. Bake at 350F for about 20 minutes or
                        until a light golden color.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the crust is baking add the sugar to a food
                        processor and add the zest of three lemons. Pulse until
                        the zest is fully incorporated and sugar is a light
                        yellow color. If you don't have a processor just mince
                        the zest and mix with the sugar in a bag or bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the sugar and remaining half cup of flour to a large
                        bowl and mix well. You can sift together however and
                        zesty sugar bits will need to get dumped out of the
                        sifter as they might clog things up and not go through.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour in the lemon juice and add the eggs then mix very
                        well until completely combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the filling onto the warm crust then transfer to
                        oven and bake for about 25 minutes, turning halfway
                        through the bake. Remove from oven and allow to cool for
                        an hour before chilling in the refrigerator for two
                        hours.

                        Dust with powdered sugar and cut into bars using a
                        clean, sharp, damp knife. Clean and re-wet the knife
                        after each cut.
