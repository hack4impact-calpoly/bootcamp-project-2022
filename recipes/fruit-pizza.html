          <p>
            Use any combination of ripe summer fruit you can find for this fresh
            fruit "pizza." The crust is one big sugar cookie that can be baked a
            day ahead and kept well wrapped until you're ready to spread it with
            the cream-cheese topping (which you can also make a day ahead). The
            dough could double as your go-to sugar cookie recipe too--just form
            it into balls and bake at 350 degrees F for a soft, chewy treat.

      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>For the sugar cookie crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>
          Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric
          mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the
          lemon zest, vanilla and egg and beat until incorporated. Add the
          flour, baking powder and salt and mix on low speed until just
          combined. Scrape the dough into a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet and
          press into an even layer to cover the entire bottom of the skillet.
          (If the dough becomes too soft to work with, pop the skillet in the
          refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Prick the
          dough all over with a fork, leaving a 1-inch border.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake the crust until golden and the edges are set, 22 to 24 minutes.
          Let cool in the skillet on a wire rack, then loosen the edges of the
          crust with a butter knife and invert onto a platter or cutting board
          to unmold. Invert again so the crust is right-side up. (To make ahead,
          let cool, then wrap well in plastic wrap and keep at room
          temperature.)
        </li>
        <li>
          For the topping: Clean out the mixer bowl and add the cream cheese and
          butter. Beat on medium speed until light and smooth, about 1 minute.
          Add the honey and vanilla and beat to combine. Add the confectioner's
          sugar and beat on low speed until just combined. Increase the speed to
          high and beat until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Refrigerate the topping,
          covered, until ready to use (stir again until smooth).
        </li>
        <li>
          To assemble the fruit pizza, spread the cream cheese topping on the
          crust in an even layer, leaving a border for the crust. Top with the
          fruit in a random pattern. Dust with more confectioner's sugar if
          using just before serving, then cut into slices.
        </li>
