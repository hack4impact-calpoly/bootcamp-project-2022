    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line an 8-inch cake pan with plastic wrap. Transfer all the ice cream to your lined cake pan and then cover with another layer of plastic. Press down into a flat layer and freeze.</li>
            <li>Prepare and cool an 8-inch chocolate cake and cover the top with the chocolate fudge sauce using an offset spatula.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle chopped cookies on top of the hot fudge.</li>
            <li>Remove the ice cream layer from the freezer, unwrap it, and place it on top of the fudge. Cover the whole thing in plastic and place in the freezer while you make the whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Combine cold whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla and mix starting on low. Gradually increase speed to high and mix until very soft peaks form. Finish off by whisking the whipped cream by hand until the peaks firm up. See my Whipped Cream Recipe for more instructions.</li>
            <li>Cover the cake with the whipped cream and transfer the rest to a piping bag fitted with a large closed star (846) tip.</li>
            <li>Pipe a drip of chocolate onto the edge of the entire cake.</li>
            <li>Pipe a scalloped pattern onto the top edge of the cake with the reserved whipped cream. Press crumbled cookies onto the bottom edge, and the cake is ready to serve. </li>
        </ol>
