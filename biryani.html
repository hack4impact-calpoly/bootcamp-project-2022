    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>
    <p>This is a popular Indian dish consisting of spicy, flavored rice and chicken.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: For the most flavor, I recommend using a bone-in skin-on piece of chicken such as thighs or drumsticks. <br>Breast meat will work in a pinch, but it won’t be as flavorful, and it will get dry due to the longer cooking time of this dish. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Aromatics</strong> – The chicken is marinated with ginger garlic paste along with herbs and spices. As the chicken steams, <br>it releases all these flavors into the rice. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Herbs</strong> – I like to use fresh herbs like cilantro (a.k.a. coriander leaves), and fresh mint leaves in my marinade for the chicken. These also make for a nice garnish to sprinkle on top of the Chicken Biryani, so be sure to chop up a little extra. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Rice</strong>- – Biryani should always be made with long-grain rice. I recommend using basmati. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint, cilantro, garam masala, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together.<br> Add the chicken pieces and toss together making sure the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the onions until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized <br>onions to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To assemble the biryani, add the saffron to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Add half the rice mixture to the bottom of the pot you browned the chicken in.</li>
    </ol>
