                                    huffman.py takes in a txt file of variable length. Shown is an example but more complicated txt files were also used.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    returned was a header with ascii value followed by the number of times that character showed up in the txt file. sorted from smallest to greatest ascii value.
                                    <span>1's and 0's represent the encoded version of the txt file. it was created by storing character and character frequency in a linked list with priority and then traversing the tree
                                        to get 1's for every right traversal and 0's for every left traversal until finally reaching a desired character. 
                                    </span>
                                </p>

                                    <span>compressed file was also returned which contains the same header as encoded file, as well as compressed version of the string</span>
                                    <span>to decode, the program takes in one of the two compressed files and outputs the original txt file (ex. takes in file2_soln.txt -> outputs file2.txt) </span>
