                                Octopus are first spawned and then fish are spawned after. The octopus seek out the fish using A Star Pathing Algorithm <br>
                                When the octopus eats fish, they bring the fish to "Atlantis" which is displayed in the first image on the near-bottom left and bottom right.<br>
                                Then, octopus is considered "not full" and can eat more fish

                                When user clicks anywhere on the viewport, lava emerges on the tile the user clicked, as well as on surrounding tiles <br>
                                Additionally, a "wyvern" is spawned where the user originally clicked. The wyvern seeks out crabs to eat using A Star as well. It can eat unlimited crabs.<br>
                                When an octopus is in the surrounding lava of where a user clicked, the octopus becomes "corrupted" and it eats other octopus', it can eat unlimited octopus.

                                Crabs seek out the grass using A Star Pathing Algorithm. When crab eats grass, an "earthquake" occurs on the tile 
                                the grass was on.
