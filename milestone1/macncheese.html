              <h2>Ingredients</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
                <li>4 cups shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese divided (measured after shredding)</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese divided (measured after shredding)</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp. salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. paprika</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

              <h2>Preparation</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13").  Set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.  Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
                <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles.  Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat.  Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand.  Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often.  Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.  Slowly pour in the remaining milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
                <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine.  Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully.  Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.  Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</li>
