            <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
                <li>10 eggs (or to preference)</li>
                <li>1 kg pork belly</li>
                <li>6 tbsp fish sauce (or to taste)</li>
                <li>5 tsp sugar (or to taste)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp chicken bouillon powder</li>
                <li>US cup coconut water</li>
                <li>3/4 US cup water</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="recipe-instructions-header">Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="recipe-instructions">
                <li>Boil the eggs for 12 minutes or until hardboiled, then peel them and set aside in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Cut the meat into 5cm or 2" chunks.</li>
                <li>Note: If you like the pieces in Thit Kho smaller, cut them to your liking.</li>
                <li>Extract the juice from the coconuts. If you're using fresh coconuts, lay them on their side and chop the cleaver down about 3cm (or 1″) from the coconut’s point. Rotate the coconut and repeat until the whole tip is removable.</li>
                <li>Pull the top off and pour the juice into a bowl and repeat for all the coconuts.</li>
                <li>On a high heat, add the sugar and stir continuously until it begins clumping together.</li>
                <li>Pour in a tablespoon of water and stir until combined. Repeat this step a tablespoon at a time with the remaining water. By the end, you will have a dark brown caramel sauce.</li>
                <li>Add the fish sauce in and stir until well combined.</li>
                <li>While the heat is still on high, put the eggs in and roll them through the sauce until they're evenly coated and have turned a slight golden color.</li>
                <li>Scoop the eggs out and set them aside in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the pork belly into the sauce and brown them on all sides.</li>
                <li>Pour the coconut water in and season with chicken bouillon powder. Stir well then bring to a boil with the lid partially on. As soon as it boils, turn the heat to medium and let it gently simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 20 minutes of simmering, put the eggs back into the pot.</li>
                <li>Simmer on low heat for another 10 minutes or until the pork is tender.</li>
