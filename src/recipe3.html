                <li>½ teaspoon Ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon Ground ginger</li>
                <li>10 tablespoon Unsalted butter browned</li>
                <li>2 cups Brown sugar packed light or dark</li>
                <li>1 cup Sour cream room temperature</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 cups Shredded carrots about 8 medium carrots</li>

            <center><h2>Instructions</h2></center>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray three 8 inch cake pans with baking non-stick spray. Place an 8 inch parchment circle on the bottom of the pans and spray again.</li>
                <li>Heat a frying pan on medium heat and melt the butter. Keep stirring the butter until it starts to foam and the milk deposits on the bottom separate. Stir until the butter starts to brown and take off heat. Pour in a glass measuring cup. Let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>While waiting, shred the carrots. Make sure they are washed and peeled first. This takes quite a few carrots. Then, in a mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix the browned butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and sour cream. Mix until smooth. Add in the carrots and mix until combined. Add in eggs and whisk until combined.</li>
                <li>Add in the dry ingredients. Fold it into the wet ingredients. Fold until combined.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter evenly into the cake pans. Use a kitchen scale to get an even amount of batter in each pan. Bake for 18-20 minutes. The cakes are done baking when a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Let the cakes sit in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Let the cakes cool completely before decorating.</li>
